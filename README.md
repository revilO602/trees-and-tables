# Storing data in dynamic structures

This project includes:\
**Own implementation of a RB tree** – _RB_BST_vlastny.h_ \
**Adapted implementation of an AVL tree** – _AVL_BST_prebraty.h_ \
**Own implementation of a hashtable with chaining** – _HASHTABLE_vlastna.h_ \
**Adapted implementation of a hashtable with open addressing** – _HASHTABLE_prebrata.h_ 


Full documentation including acceptance tests, space efficiency tests, time efficiency tests, full analysis including big O notation calculations and comparisons for insert and search operations is in  _dokumentacia.pdf_ in Slovak.

This is the second project from my Data Structures and Algorithms university course.
